  <h1> Why Charles Martinet should have played Mario in the upcoming movie. </h1>
  
  <br>

 <p> Charles Martinet <a class="emphasize" target="_blank"> should've</a> been given the rule to play Mario in the upcoming 2023 movie, due to the iconic nature of his voice, and his undeniable passion for the character.</p>

  <tr>
    <th> Reason </th>
    <th> Description </th> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Chris Pratt's Role in Hollywood </td>
    <td>Pratt may have been selected for the role, due to the fact that Pratt is an A-list actor. This completely disregards the iconic roots of Mario, and pairs him with an uncanny voice.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Lack of Passion</td>
    <td>Pratt's lack of passion in the Mario movie is undeniable, evident by a very calm, unamused voice in the trailers.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Martinet's Passion</td>
    <td>Martinet has been playing Mario for over 30 years, with his voice becoming incredibly iconic all over the world.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Martinet's Talent</td>
    <td>Martinet is a professional voice actor, and should be taken seriously for a big budget Hollywood film. Martinet would be able to easily adjust his voice for a full-length film.</td>

  <tr>
    <th> Reason </th>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Martinet's voice is annoying. </td>
    <td>Some people have criticized Martinet's voice as too high pitched for a full length film. However, Martinet is a professional voice actor. His experience in the industry undoubtedly gives him the ability to tweak his voice for a full-length film, while maintaining the iconic voice that the world has grown to love.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>We'll get used to it.</td>
    <td>Many people believe that over time, we will get used to this voice. However, that doesn't really argue much, and just illustrates the error Nintendo has made even more.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>It needs to change for a full movie.</td>
    <td>It is believed that the Mario should be fully reset for a full film. However, Mario is such an already established character worldwide, that a reset is pointless.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Martinet can't reflect emotional moments in his perfomance.</td>
    <td>Some have also said that Martinet wouldn't be able to give more emotion to Mario for a full film, due to his happy nature in the games. However, I reiterate that Martinet is a professional voice actor, and deserves to be taken seriously.</td>
